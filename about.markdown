title: About NABES

The vision of the Network of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental
Statistics (NABES) is to establish a UK-wide network of quantitative experts
working in applied agricultural, biological and environmental sciences, with
the principal aim of developing a community of practice through the sharing of
statistical and biomathematical expertise and resources.

Many applied research and implementation organisations have small numbers of
quantitative experts – often as low as one, and frequently having none at all
with formal training in statistics or biomathematics.

The network we establish will be a “one-stop shop” for advice, guidance and
expertise in statistics and data science for research and implementation in
agriculture, bioscience, food, nutrition, public health, ecology and
environment.  Quantitative experts in government agencies, NGOs, applied
research institutes, and the commercial sector – whether formally trained data
scientists or otherwise – will have access to peer support and potential
collaborators to enable better use of expensively collected and maintained data
sets, and provide better value for funders.
