**Building a shared careers talk for NABES**  

Prompted by earlier observations of difficulties recruiting for environmental and agricultural statistics roles, Peter Henrys (UKCEH) is leading the development of a NABES careers talk. The aim is to collectively put together a slide pack which can be delivered by anyone in the network, with hopes of increasing the visibility of statistics in environmental and agricultural sectors as a career path for graduates. 

The second session in our [program](/events) of monthly workshops focussed on collating ideas for the content of this talk. Discussions were held in small groups, and the themes that emerged from these include: 

* Having varied work and making a positive real-world impact as some of the pros of working in environmental / agricultural statistics. 

* The wide range of roles and employers offering roles in this area. 

* Including case studies in the talk to show what these roles might be like. 

The discussion also identified some next steps we should take, particularly in progressing our outreach and engagement.
