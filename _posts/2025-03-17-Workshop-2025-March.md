In March we came together for a workshop on building statistical literacy within our organisations. George Savva (Quadram), Suzanne Clark (Rothamsted Research) and Isabel Corkley (ADAS) led the session, and we explored what statistical literacy means, shared examples of what did and didn’t work and asked how NABES could help. 

## What do we mean by statistical literacy?

George reflected on how he is currently reviewing how to build statistical literacy within his workplace. He noted that statistical literacy is about helping scientists engage with variation in data and uncertainty in results. This might involve being able to:  

* Critically read literature 

* Design robust research 

* Analyse and interpret findings 

* Communicate well with statisticians (and vice versa) 

* Talk about uncertainty with wider audiences 

Different approaches (such as developing educational programmes, continuing professional development, informal discussions, mentoring and consultancy) for improving statistical literacy might be appropriate depending on what was required, our own capacity in terms of time and ability as trainers and the availability of other resources including people and training material. He also encouraged us to look at pedagogic resources and scholarly work to see what else was available. 

Reflections from the group around how they defined statistical literacy included not just being able to understand statistical concepts but also being able to recognise when working with a statistician would be useful.  

## How do we build statistical literacy? An example 

Suzanne gave an overview of the statistics training she and colleagues deliver at Rothamsted to scientists including PhD students, staff and visitors. Their aim is to help scientists speak the same language as statisticians so they can collaborate better or work more independently, whichever is appropriate. Their four-tiered training programme builds from basic concepts, summary statistics and simple hypothesis tests, through ANOVA and linear regression to more complex methods such as generalized linear and non-linear models, and multivariate and spatial statistics. A complementary book ([Statistical methods in biology – Book website](http://www.stats4biol.info/)) covering many of these topics has also been published to assist others with learning and teaching these ideas. 

## How could NABES build a common resource? 

Isabel introduced the idea of NABES building up shared resources to assist in building statistical literacy across organisations. She asked about what resources already existed, what we would like, how we can effectively share this and if specific resources, such as bite-sized introductions to statistical topics, could be useful (she is already trying to do this for her organisation) 

Lots of useful ideas came out of these group discussions which we will be taking forward to help NABES as a network support the building of statistical literacy across organisations with NABES members.
