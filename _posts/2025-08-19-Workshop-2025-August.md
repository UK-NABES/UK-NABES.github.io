### This month’s workshop was a Consultancy Corner, where members can share ideas to help tackle problems together!

**Multivariate chemicals analysis**  
The first conversation focussed on methods for analysing chemicals in water data, with a particular focus on the challenge of left censoring where measurements fall below the analytical limit of detection. Given that many tools exist for analysing multivariate ecological data, could some of these be adapted for chemicals data, taking into account the censored structure? This sparked an interesting discussion, with some suggestions including imputation techniques, summing concentrations and treating chemicals as random effects. It’s clear there’s lots of opportunities for developing statistical methods for chemicals data.  

  
**Teaching basic probability**  
In the second discussion, we shared resources for teaching basic probability to non-mathematicians, including Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath and ‘Hands-on statistics’ resources from the Royal Statistical Society.  


This was another insightful meeting, with the network supporting each other by sharing resources and expertise!
