We had a very lively chat at this monthâ€™s Round Table where people shared news, what we were all working on, and asked for inputs.


A key theme in this round table was on using data to guide decision making and policy and the discussions included:

* Creating a decision support app to identify a threshold for farmers to check their fields for the presence of yellow barley dwarf virus
* Using rod-and-line salmon catch data to inform river catch-and-release policy
* Using the Natural Capital Assets Index to identify how these assets can improve different policy areas within Scotland.
