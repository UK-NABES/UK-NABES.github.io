In his experience of making British Geological Society products, Ben Marchant (BGS) has seen how difficult it is to create measures of uncertainty which are useful to decision-makers, especially when looking at spatial information. This motivated the selection of the paper for this month’s journal club - Decisions, uncertainty and spatial information by [Lark et al (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211675322000161).   

Themes covered in the paper include:  

* Generalised and decision-focused measures of uncertainty  

* Misinterpretation of uncertainty by map users  

* The need for both verbal descriptions (e.g. likely, unlikely) and numerical values (e.g. 90%) to reduce the chance of bias in interpreting uncertainty estimates 

* Understanding the decision-making process and tailoring expressions of uncertainty to how the map will be used   

Some of the points raised in discussion were:  

* Separating out measures of risk from measures of uncertainty  

* Additional challenges that occur when a map has multiple uses in different decisions  

* How ideas around elicitation might be useful in thinking about how people understand uncertainty    

* Presenting neutral datasets and interactive tools – allowing users to decide what uncertainty means to them, but with a risk of the data being misused

  

Ben also covered two papers comparing methods for presenting uncertain information.  

* The [first](https://doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2021.2020278) covers differences in decisions when information is framed positively (probability of exceeding a threshold) and negatively (probability of falling below the threshold)  

* The [second](https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-4-245-2021) evaluates the effectiveness of different methods for communicating uncertainty by eliciting stakeholder opinions.    

  

For a further look into these topics, the works of these authors were mentioned:  

* Anthony O'Hagan – expert elicitation  

* David Spiegelhalter – communicating risk and uncertainty    

  

Conversations towards the end of the meeting also sparked new ideas for future sessions:  

* Interacting with policymakers   

* Software options and approaches for experimental design
