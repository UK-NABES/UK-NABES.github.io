The vision of the Network of Agricultural, Biological and Environmental
Statistics (NABES) is to establish a UK-wide network of quantitative experts
working in applied agricultural, biological and environmental sciences, with
the principal aim of developing a community of practice through the sharing of
statistical and biomathematical expertise and resources.
