I joined the Babraham Institute as a Biostatistician in the Bioinformatics group in July 2023. I support scientists with their experimental design, data analysis and statistics, including providing advice, teaching statistics courses, and undertaking consultancy work. I work across many different projects, with several so far being in proteomics data analysis.
Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of Birmingham on ‘Transcriptional and histological characterisation of the synovium in early inflammatory arthritis’, which had a large bioinformatic and data analysis component. I then worked in health policy for a short time, focusing on the use of genomics and emerging technologies in healthcare.
