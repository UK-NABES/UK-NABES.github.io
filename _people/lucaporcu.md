My name is Luca. I was born on November 22, 1973, in Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy. I am a biostatistician. For about 15 years I have been involved in statistical design and analysis of clinical studies in Milan, Italy. Then I discovered the complexity of biology by chance. I became a member of the Institutional Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Body as methodologist. I completed my PhD at the Open University with a thesis on the methodological pitfalls of Preclinical In Vivo Antitumour Activity Experiments. I joined the CRUK Cambridge Institute in April 2023. I am involved in the statistical design and analysis of preclinical in vivo experiments and, broadly, preclinical data. I am a member of the Institutional Animal Welfare and Ethics Review Body.
