Dr Pete Henrys is a chartered statistician — CStat, Royal Statistical Society — at UKCEH, with over 15 years’ experience of monitoring network design and large scale spatial and temporal analysis of environmental data. He has led teams to design multiple long term monitoring programmes which are now successfully operational. These include: the design of the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (Welsh Government); the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (DAERA); the England Ecosystem System Survey (Defra); and, the Small Streams Network (EA). He has also advised the EA and NRW on the design and development of their sentinel river networks.

Pete has developed approaches for upscaling survey data to large, national scale maps while quantifying the uncertainty. He has led teams across a number of projects as PI and Co-I to develop novel analytical approaches to link key environmental indicators to different drivers across spatial and temporal scales. He has experience of analysing complex large-scale data sets and integrating across different scales and structures using both Bayesian and multivariate approaches. Pete sits on committees for the Royal Statistical Society and the National Trust.
